# Introduction 

Before diving into Security and Penetration testing, itâ€™s essential to understand the Android Environment. There are several key concepts one should be familiar with before getting started. 

Firstly, the Android operating system is essentially a Linux operating system. Therefore, it is helpful to be familiar with the basics of Linux, such as file permissions and navigating the file system. 

One should understand the differences between normal users and root users and have a deep conceptual understanding of how groups work in Linux. 

Most of the examples shown in this documentation will use a Linux-style operating system.  

> To understand the basics of Linux and become well-versed, refer to [this link](https://tldp.org/LDP/gs/node5.html). 

Like Linux, the Android operating system is open-source, which means we have the option to inspect the source code without the effort of extracting it first. The source code can be obtained from here. 

Additionally, familiarity with the Java programming language will help follow some of the code examples given throughout this documentation. 

In case there is a need to refresh concepts of Java or study from scratch, [this link](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/) can be used.
